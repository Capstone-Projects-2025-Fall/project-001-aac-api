# System Overview

## Project Abstract

This document proposes an application programming interface (API) that supports AAC games. The API will allow users to play AAC games like StoryQuest through external AAC board interaction, rather than being forced to rely on an embedded AAC board in the game. Users can relay game inputs by either speaking with their mouths or speaking through their AAC board. The API will enable audio-controlled games, which will support social and communication skills in children who use AAC devices by enabling AAC users to play games alongside non-AAC users.
