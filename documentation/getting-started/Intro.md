# Getting Started

Our goal is to make it easy for you to integrate voice controls into your web application. Whether you’re building something new or enhancing an existing project. AACommodate API integrates seamlessly into both.

To see our code in action, feel free to explore a simple coloring game in which we show our code in use here: [Sample Coloring Game](https://github.com/Russo903/aac-voice-api-milestone-demo-1.git)

## Why AACommodate API?

This page is for developers who want to learn how to use our npm package to enable voice interaction in their apps.

While our primary focus has been AAC (Augmentative and Alternative Communication) game developers, the AACommodate API can be used by any developer looking to integrate voice-activated controls into their project with ease.

# How to add to your Project

```bash
npm install aac-voice-api
```
or
```bash
npm i aac-voice-api
```
