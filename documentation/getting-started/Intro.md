# Getting Started

Our goal is to make it easy for you to integrate voice controls into your web application — whether you’re building something new or enhancing an existing project. The AACommodate API integrates seamlessly into both.

## Why AACommodate API?

This page is for developers who want to learn how to use our npm package to enable voice interaction in their apps.

While our primary focus has been AAC (Augmentative and Alternative Communication) game developers — hence our name — the AACommodate API can be used by any developer looking to integrate voice-activated controls into their project with ease.
