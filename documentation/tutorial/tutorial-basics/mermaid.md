# Mermaid Diagrams (UML) üßú‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
Using [Mermaid](https://mermaid-js.github.io/mermaid/#/) to create diagrams and visualizations directly in Docusaurus offers significant advantages over static images. With Mermaid, your diagrams are written as code, making them easy to version control, review, and update alongside your documentation. This approach ensures your diagrams always stay in sync with your project, reduces maintenance overhead, and eliminates the hassle of regenerating and uploading new images for every change. As your project evolves, updating a diagram is as simple as editing a few lines of text, making your documentation more agile, consistent, and future-proof.
Mermaid supports a variety of diagram types, including flowcharts, sequence diagrams, class diagrams, state diagrams, and more. Below are some examples of how to create different types of UML diagrams using Mermaid syntax.

## Structural
### Class Diagrams
Class diagrams are used to represent the structure of a system by showing its classes, attributes, methods, and the relationships between them. Here's an example of a simple class diagram:

````md
```mermaid
classDiagram
    class Animal {
        +String name
        +int age
        +void makeSound()
    }
    class Dog {
        +String breed
        +void bark()
    }
    class Cat {
        +String color
        +void meow()
    }
    Animal <|-- Dog
    Animal <|-- Cat
```
````
This will render the following diagram:

```mermaid
classDiagram
    class Animal {
        +String name
        +int age
        +void makeSound()
    }
    class Dog {
        +String breed
        +void bark()
    }
    class Cat {
        +String color
        +void meow()
    }
    Animal <|-- Dog
    Animal <|-- Cat
```
### Entity-Relationship Diagrams (not technically UML, but widely used in software design)
Entity-Relationship diagrams are used to represent the relationships between entities in a database. Here's an example of a simple ER diagram:

````md
```mermaid
erDiagram
    CUSTOMER ||--o{ ORDER : places
    ORDER ||--|{ LINE-ITEM : contains
    CUSTOMER }|..|{ DELIVERY-ADDRESS : uses
```
````
This will render the following diagram:

```mermaid
erDiagram
    CUSTOMER ||--o{ ORDER : places
    ORDER ||--|{ LINE-ITEM : contains
    CUSTOMER }|..|{ DELIVERY-ADDRESS : uses
```

You can also define entities with attributes primary keys and foreign keys:

````md
```mermaid
erDiagram
    CUSTOMER {
        string name
        string custNumber PK
        string sector
    }
    ORDER {
        int orderNumber PK
        string deliveryAddress
        string custNumber FK
    }
    CUSTOMER ||--o{ ORDER : places
```
````

```mermaid
erDiagram
    CUSTOMER {
        string name
        string custNumber PK
        string sector
    }
    ORDER {
        int orderNumber PK
        string deliveryAddress
        string custNumber FK
    }
    CUSTOMER ||--o{ ORDER : places
```


## Behavioral
### Sequence Diagram
Sequence diagrams are used to represent interactions between different entities over time. Here's an example of a simple sequence diagram:

````md
```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
participant Alice
participant Bob
Alice->>Bob: Hello Bob, how are you?
Bob-->>Alice: I am good thanks!
```
````

This will render the following diagram:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Alice
    participant Bob
    Alice->>Bob: Hello Bob, how are you?
    Bob-->>Alice: I am good thanks!
```

You can also represent participants and actors:

````md
```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    actor  Alice
    actor  Bob
    Alice->>Bob: Hello Bob, how are you?
    Bob-->>Alice: I am good thanks!
```
````

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    actor  Alice
    actor  Bob
    Alice->>Bob: Hello Bob, how are you?
    Bob-->>Alice: I am good thanks!

```

### State Diagrams
State diagrams are used to represent the states of an object and the transitions between those states. Here's an example of a simple state diagram:

````md
```mermaid
stateDiagram
    [*] --> Still
    Still --> [*]

    Still --> Moving
    Moving --> Still
    Moving --> Crash
    Crash --> [*]
```
````
This will render the following diagram:

```mermaid
stateDiagram
    [*] --> Still
    Still --> [*]

    Still --> Moving
    Moving --> Still
    Moving --> Crash
    Crash --> [*]
```

### Use Case Diagrams
There is currently no official support for Use Case diagrams in Mermaid... maybe some day... until then you may have to resort to images from draw.io or similar tools. 




## Non UML Examples (Architectural Diagrams)
UML is great for standardized diagrams, but there many diagrams that aren't covered by UML such as system block diagrams. Mermaid can also be used to create these types of diagrams. Theres 3 ways currently to draw system block diagrams in Mermaid (some of which are still in beta). Here's an example of a simple system block diagram using the `graph` syntax:

````md
```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Client] --> B[Load Balancer]
    B --> C[Web Server 1]
    B --> D[Web Server 2]
    C --> E[Database]
    D --> E[Database]
```
````

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Client] --> B[Load Balancer]
    B --> C[Web Server 1]
    B --> D[Web Server 2]
    C --> E[Database]
    D --> E[Database]
```

Graphs are great, but you have less control over the layout. If you want more control over the layout, you can use the `block` syntax:

````md
```mermaid
block
columns 1
  db(("DB"))
  blockArrowId6<["&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"]>(down)
  block:ID
    A
    B["A wide one in the middle"]
    C
  end
  space
  D
  ID --> D
  C --> D
  style B fill:#969,stroke:#333,stroke-width:4px
```
````

```mermaid
block
columns 1
  db(("DB"))
  blockArrowId6<["&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"]>(down)
  block:ID
    A
    B["A wide one in the middle"]
    C
  end
  space
  D
  ID --> D
  C --> D
  style B fill:#969,stroke:#333,stroke-width:4px
```

There is also a new `architecture` syntax that is still in beta, but provides a more industry standard SaaS architecture layout great for cloud based systems:

````md
```mermaid
architecture-beta
    group api(cloud)[API]

    service db(database)[Database] in api
    service disk1(disk)[Storage] in api
    service disk2(disk)[Storage] in api
    service server(server)[Server] in api

    db:L -- R:server
    disk1:T -- B:server
    disk2:T -- B:db
```
````

```mermaid
architecture-beta
    group api(cloud)[API]

    service db(database)[Database] in api
    service disk1(disk)[Storage] in api
    service disk2(disk)[Storage] in api
    service server(server)[Server] in api

    db:L -- R:server
    disk1:T -- B:server
    disk2:T -- B:db
```
