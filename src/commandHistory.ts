/**
 * CommandHistory keeps track of a chronological log of commands.

 * - Add new commands to the history (if logging is enabled).
 * - Retrieve all commands or a slice of commands.
 * - Query the total number of commands logged.
 * - Enable or disable logging.
 * - Clear the entire history.
 * 
 * Commands are stored in memory in the order they were added. 
 * Slices and retrievals return copies of the array to prevent external mutation.
 * There is no built-in limit on how many commands are stored.
