Web Audio API and RNNoise will be used to clean the audio. This process isolates the users AAC device from ambient sound and other voices. The API is structured for reusability. A game developer integrates the library by initializing with a config object.

This technological gap can lead to frustrating user experience and social exclusion for AAC users. Current solutions for this issue generally look like this. Involving in game, simulated AAC boards, which require users to learn a new, game specific interface rather than using their own familiar device. This project addresses these limitations by developing a reusable software tool, a developer focused API, rather than a single, standalone game. The goal is to provide a solution that game developers can integrate into any new or exisiting web based application.
